title: "External scripts"
---

Additional standalone scripts for various common tasks are added to the path when this package is installed.
They are less robust than the [CLI Utilities](cli) included in the package and do not have any unit tests.

:::{.callout-warning}
The `run_jobby_on_*` scripts have been deprecated. Please use `jobby` directly.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
from ccbr_tools.pkg_util import get_pyproject_toml
from pathlib import Path
print('\n'.join([f"  - [`{Path(script).name}`](https://github.com/CCBR/Tools/tree/main/{script})" for script in get_pyproject_toml()['tool']['setuptools']['script-files']]))
```
