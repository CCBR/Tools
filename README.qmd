## Installation

{{< include docs/install.qmd >}}

## Basic usage

{{< include docs/basic_usage.qmd >}}

## CLI Utilities

Command-line utilities in CCBR Tools.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
import ccbr_tools.pkg_util
print("\n".join([f"  - `{cmd}`" for cmd in ccbr_tools.pkg_util.get_project_scripts()]))
```

Run a command with `--help` to learn how to use it.

## External Scripts

Additional standalone scripts for various common tasks in [scripts/](scripts/) are added to the path when this package is installed.
They are less robust than the CLI Utilities included in the package and do not have any unit tests.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
from ccbr_tools.pkg_util import get_pyproject_toml
from pathlib import Path
print('\n'.join([f"  - [`{Path(script).name}`]({script})" for script in get_pyproject_toml()['tool']['setuptools']['script-files']]))
```
